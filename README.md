# StethoDoc: Democratising Screening for Lung Disorders with an Augmented Reality Guided Smart Stethoscope 
StethoDoc is an augmented reality guided smart stethoscope system. 
It allows non-medical laypersons to perform accurate pulmonary screening at a fraction of the traditional cost, thus reducing the pressure on the overburdened healthcare system. StethoDoc has two main components in the form of a smartphone app - an interactive augmented reality frontend which guides the user in placing the stethoscope at the correct sites and an artificial intelligence backend for identifying pulmonary disorders. The app is connected to a generic stethoscope via a microphone.
